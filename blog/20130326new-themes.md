The team is proud to announce the new themes for MATE 1.6. **Menta** will be
the default theme for the upcoming new release. It consists of a nice GTK2/3
theme (based on Mint-Z Improved, no longer maintained, customized for MATE and
updated for GTK3.6) and a child theme of mate-icon-theme with green folders.

  * **GreenLaguna**: A nice theme based on green color.
  * **BlackMATE**: A black based theme, without green.
We would like to thank Wolfgang Ulbrich and Marcel Dijkstra for this great
job.  ![BlackMATE theme](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03
