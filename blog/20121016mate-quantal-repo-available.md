An Ubuntu 12.10 repo is now available for our 1.4 release. As usual, follow
[these instructions](http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/download?) to install. If
you're upgrading from an older release, please make sure that you remove the
old repos and add the new repos. Otherwise, you will encounter problems.
