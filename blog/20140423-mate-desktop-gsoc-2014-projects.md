After several weeks of review the application and selection period for the 
2014 Google Summer of Code is over. 4,420 students proposed a total of 6,313 
projects for this summer. From those, 1,307 students have been accepted and 
the MATE Desktop project is one of the 190 Open Source projects that will be 
working with students this year.

In our second year as a GSoC mentoring organisation, we received 4
applications and Google allocated us 2 slots for student projects.

I'm delighted to introduce our GSoC students for 2014:

  * Avishkar Gupta will be working on adding ePub rendering capabilities to
  Atril, the document viewer of the MATE desktop.
  * Michal Ratajsky will be working on adding GStreamer 1.0 support into the 
  MATE desktop environment in order to replace dependency on the deprecated 
  GStreamer 0.10 library.

Please join me in welcoming these new contributors to the MATE team and
join me in wishing them every success with their respective projects for
the summer.

On behalf on the entire MATE team I'd like to extend our thanks and gratitude 
to [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org) who are our GSoC organiser for 2014. 
They did a fantastic job in helping secure these GSoC placements for the MATE 
project.
