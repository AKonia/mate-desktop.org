The MATE team is proud to announce collabortaion with the
[galcualtor](http://galculator.sourceforge.net/) team and that galculator
will replace `mate-calc` in MATE 1.10.

## What is galculator?

From the galculator website:

> galculator is a GTK 2 / GTK 3 based calculator with ordinary
notation/reverse polish notation (RPN), a formula entry mode,
different number bases (DEC, HEX, OCT, BIN) and different units of
angular measure (DEG, RAD, GRAD). It supports quad-precision
floating point and 112-bit binary arithmetic.

galculator's main features include:

  * Algebraic mode, RPN (Reverse Polish Notation), Formula Entry and Paper mode
  * Decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary number base
  * Radiant, degree and grad support
  * Basic and Scientific Mode
  * User defined constants and functions
  * Trigonometric functions, power, sqare root, natural and common logarithm, inverse and hyperbolic functions
  * Binary arithmetic of configurable bit length and signedness
  * Quad-precision floating point arithmetic
  * 112-bit binary arithmetic
  * Copy and paste
  * Available in more than 20 translations.

Like MATE galculator has a commitmet to GTK2 and GTK3 and is actively
maintained.

## Why ditch mate-calc?

While `mate-calc` is functional it lacks many features required of a
modern desktop calcualtor. The MATE team is small with limited resources
and where possible we are attempting to collaborate with projects that
add value to MATE and reduce development burden on the MATE team.
galculator is a perfect fit in this regard.

## What's in it for the galculator team?

galcualtor will remain an entirely independant project but we hope that
its inclusion in MATE will grow the galcualtor user base, raise awareness
about galcualtor and attract new contributors to the project. To that
end the MATE team will host the galcualtor translations as a resource on
the [MATE transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/organization/mate/dashboard/MATE).
We are hopeful that our ~300 heroic translators will embrace glacualtor
and add to the ~20 languages it currently supports.

## I am a packager. What does this mean for me?

If you are a MATE package maintainer then start creating galcualtor
packages for your distribution if they do not already exist and add
galculator to your MATE meta packages or package groups. MATE 1.10 is a
way off yet, so you have plenty of time.

Hopefully you undertand our reasoning and can see the mutual advantages
for this partnership. Let us know what you think in the comments.
