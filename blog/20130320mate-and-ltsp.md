There are a lot of people in the world who get access to their GNU/Linux
desktops via thin clients, and one of the longest running thin client projects
out there is the [LTSP](http://ltsp.org) project. The MATE desktop offers a
fantastic desktop experience on thin clients; fast, stable, and efficient.
Libraries, schools, and businesses looking for a GNU/Linux desktop using
traditional paradigms their users are used to will find MATE a excellent
alternative to going to a Unity/Gnome 3 desktop. As both an LTSP and MATE
developer, I put together a short
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnL47bbFN68) on some of the
developments in both.
