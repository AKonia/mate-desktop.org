Recently, Clement Lefebvre of Linux Mint has had discussions with the
developers of Geany about possibly creating a lightweight version of Geany
(we'll call it Geany Lite in this post). At this point, Geany Lite is nothing
more than an idea and it's unknown whether or not this idea will come to
fruition, so please keep that in mind while reading this post. So far, the
only differences between Geany and Geany Lite that have been discussed are the
default hiding of UI features that are more suited for developers than users
seeking a lightweight text editor. You can follow the discussion on the Geany
mailing list [here
(October)](http://lists.geany.org/pipermail/devel/2012-October/007128.html)
and [here
(November)](http://lists.geany.org/pipermail/devel/2012-November/007190.html).
The point of this post is to provide a brief overview of why we thinking
dropping Pluma in favor of Geany Lite would be a good change and to determine
how our users feel about this. If you feel strongly about whether or not we
should make this change, now is your chance to let your opinion be known. If
we receive a strong negative reaction, we will not go through with it. The
main reason we are interested in using Geany Lite as the default text editor
for MATE is that it will receive significantly more attention from developers
than Pluma will. The MATE team is very small and maintains a very large number
of packages, so we can't guarantee that Pluma will receive the attention it
deserves every release cycle. Since Geany has its own dev team that is
independent of MATE, our users would be getting a text editor that is
consistently being improved and bug fixes would be released in a more timely
fashion. We believe that adopting Geany Lite in place of Pluma would provide
our users with the best possible experience going forward. Please respond to
this post with your feelings (positive or negative) regarding this potential
change. Again, Geany Lite is just an idea and it's possible that it never
comes into existence. In order to make it easier for use to sort through user
feedback, we will not be approving comments that are unrelated to this topic.
Feel free to stop by #mate on irc.freenode.net to discuss the idea further.
