On the way to getting MATE officially available on [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org),
the community repositories have to be changed in YaST. For that,
go to _YaST -> Software -> Software Repositories_ and remove the _X11:MATE:Factory_
repo and next, click on the following links in function of your openSUSE
version:

  * <http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/MATE:/STABLE:/1.6/openSUSE_12.2/X11:MATE:STABLE:1.6.repo> for OpenSUSE 12.2
  * <http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/MATE:/STABLE:/1.6/openSUSE_12.3/X11:MATE:STABLE:1.6.repo> for OpenSUSE 12.3
  * <http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/MATE:/STABLE:/1.6/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/X11:MATE:STABLE:1.6.repo> for OpenSUSE Tumbleweed

Thank you!
