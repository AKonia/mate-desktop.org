As usual, we asked people from distributions that ship MATE what they think about our
Desktop Environment.

**Mike Gabriel**, [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) developer and MATE maintainer:

> I see MATE as one of the most being used desktop shells in Debian
Jessie (and beyond).

**Tom Wijsman**, [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org) developer and MATE maintainer:

> Part of our users express that they want to stay with GNOME 2; because
they like how things used to be, they run older hardware or they want a
more lightweight desktop.
Given that GNOME 2 becomes unsupported and will eventually be removed
from our meta distribution due to various maintenance, regression and
security issues; MATE brings back all the glory with an active
development team. Their continuation of GNOME 2's development fixes
outstanding issues, brings new and useful features and keeps the good
old experience alive and kicking.

**Willy Sudiarto Raharjo**, Co-developer of [MATE SlackBuilds Project](http://mateslackbuilds.github.io/):

> MATE shared the same basic philosophies of Slackware, such as
simplicity, stability, and no fixed release schedule. It will be
released when it's ready and preserving the same metaphor which is
proven to be working well.
MATE is also easy to be maintained and integrated on top of Slackware
since Patrick Volkerding has given a solid foundation as the base
layer in which MATE could fill the need of GNOME-based Desktop
Environment which Slackware lack of since 2005.
I'm looking forward for the evolutionary changes that MATE developers
will integrate for the next major release of MATE.

**Chess Griffin**, Co-developer of [MATE SlackBuilds Project](http://mateslackbuilds.github.io/):

> MATE is a great desktop environment for those who like the old GNOME 2
experience.  I greatly appreciate all the hard work that is put into MATE
to keep it stable and mature yet at the same time incorporating new bits
where appropriate.  The effort to keep MATE agnostic in terms of the user's
operating system or distribution is also to be applauded.  I enjoy being a
part of the MATE SlackBuilds project, which aims to bring the MATE desktop
to the Slackware Linux community.  Thanks to the entire MATE team!

**Benjamin Denisart**, [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/) MATE maintainer:

> The openSUSE team wants to thank MATE developers for their efforts
provided for this new version and is proud to announce the availability
of gnome-main-menu, for the happiness of users attractived by
traditional and easy desktop mind. It's a pleasure for us to work with
MATEs and we want to adress them our congratulations.

**Clement Lefebvre**, [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/) founder and project leader:

> MATE proudly carries the colors of GNOME 2 and continues where the project
left off. In many ways and for many people MATE just feels like home.
It's simple, stable and full featured. While more recent desktops experiment
with new concepts, MATE provides an environment which works exactly as you'd
expect it. It's popular within our users and it's the desktop on top of which
Linux Mint built its technology and identity since 2006. We're very proud
and very happy to support MATE and delighted with each and every new release.

**Wolfgang Ulbrich**, MATE maintainer in [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/): 

> During the Fedora 15/16 releases i was very dissatisfied about the desktop
solutions included. After 10 month of using XFCE i got noticed about the
MATE desktop, so i decided to build my own desktop for Fedora in December
2011. This work resulted in the first external MATE Desktop repository
for Fedora and was used by many users worldwide. There were Fedora
spins with that packages in Russia, Latvia and Indonesia.
The corollary to this work was to bring the MATE Desktop inside official
Fedora together with Dan Mashal with Fedora 18. Two releases later we have
a stable and usable desktop solution MATE 1.6 in Fedora 20. MATE 1.8 is
currently in Fedora rawhide and will be released with fedora 21 in summer.

MATE 1.8 is the result of 11 months of intense development and contains 1845
contributions by 57 people, and more than 291 translators.
