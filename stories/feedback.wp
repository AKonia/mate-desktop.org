<ul><li>Linux Mint has been in the spotlight a lot lately, and I find it unfair that Mate hasn't gotten more coverage. I use LM12 with Mate on my computer and find that Mate is now a mature, stable, full-fledged replica of Gnome2. Perberos, Stefano, et al. rose to the occasion when the need for a Gnome2 fork arose and they did the work well and quickly.
I find it difficult to understand how a lot of Linux news blogs go on and on about how XFCE and Cinnamon are sufficiently Gnome2-like to be alternatives for disenfranchised Gnome2 users...often with no mention of Mate! (Or, when Mate is mentioned, it is in the last sentence as an afterthought.) HELLO?! This is like talking to a bereaved cat owner about getting a dog or a hamster, when he can easily get a new CAT--one that is a clone of the one he lost, no less.

I don't want something that's Gnome2-LIKE unless I have no choice--I want Gnome2! It is what I know how to use and it was perfect just as it was (i.e., it had no perceived deficiencies). For you guys out there who feel the same way, know that Mate is a stable and fully-functional EXACT REPLICA of Gnome2.

I'm looking forward to using LM13-LTS with Mate for at least 5 years, and hope that Mate will continue to be developed and included with Linux Mint releases into the distant future. Also, I hope that the Mate developers stay conservative and faithful to their philosophy that not all change is progress. Thank you Perberos, Stefano, and Clem. Many, many thanks :)</li>

<ul><li>Hi,
I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you to all involved in developing the MATE desktop environment. I have been using Linux as my only OS since 2006, and was always comfortable with the gnome desktop. Today, I have upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 and was very angry at how counter intuitive and confusing the Unity desktop is. After a little search I found out about MATE and immediately installed it. Success! I have a functional and intuitive desktop environment once again!

Some people would say "It is only a desktop environment" but to me it is very important to have a desktop which is easy to use and can be customised to the way i like it. MATE has done this for me and has allowed me to keep using Ubuntu.

Well done to everyone involved.

Grazie! MATE lo ha aiutato a liberarsi dell'UNITÀ terribile in Ubuntu 11.10! Ben cotto a tutto. (sorry for poor translation!!!!</li>

<ul><li>Very good start. Things work great so far. This is only the beginning and I am quite pleased with the way it is working. Keep up the great development. I never want to be forced into gnome3. It's just a mess!</li>
