<html><body><p>We are currently in the process of switching to handling all our issues on the mate-desktop github <a title="mate-deskto github" href="https://github.com/mate-desktop" target="_blank">page</a> instead of Perberos' <a title="Perberos' issue page" href="https://github.com/perberos/Mate-Desktop-Environment/issues?sort=updated&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open" target="_blank">page</a>. The reason is simple: when Perberos is away none of the other developers can close tickets. This creates a bit of a mess.


Now, when you go to report a bug you must chose the correct github repo to issue the bug in. It's pretty simple. If there's a bug with mate-panel, then submit the issue on the mate-panel issue tracker.



Once we close these last few open bugs (yes it says 22, but we can't close many that have been solved) we'll no longer be monitoring Perberos' issue tracker, so we ask that you refrain from opening new bugs there.



Thanks for your cooperation.</p></body></html>
