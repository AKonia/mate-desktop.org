We're proud to announce our newest package on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-university">MATE University</a>! It will be targeted at all levels of developers (including beginners) to learn how to develop new panel applets, Caja (file manager) extensions, pluma (text editor) and eom (image viewer) plugins, etc. to expand the already powerful MATE Desktop experience.



There will be simple and well commented code, makefiles and tips to use as springboard for new MATE applications.</body></html>
