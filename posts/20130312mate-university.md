![c-file](/martin/Migration/files/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/c-file.png) We're
proud to announce our newest package on GitHub: [MATE
University](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-university)! It will be
targeted at all levels of developers (including beginners) to learn how to
develop new panel applets, Caja (file manager) extensions, pluma (text editor)
and eom (image viewer) plugins, etc. to expand the already powerful MATE
Desktop experience. There will be simple and well commented code, makefiles
and tips to use as springboard for new MATE applications.
