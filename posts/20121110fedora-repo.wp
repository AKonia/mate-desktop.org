<html><body><strong>UPDATE 11/11/2012:</strong>
I've been told that the repo is back up. I've also been made aware that the Dropbox repo and the repo included in Fedora conflict and can make the desktop unusable. Please consult #fedora-mate for help if you plan on moving from one repo to the other.



<strong>Original Post:</strong>

It's been brought to our attention that the Fedora repo that is hosted on Dropbox no longer works due to an excessive amount of bandwidth being used. We are now directing users to use the official Fedora repo now. For instructions on using this repo, please consult our wiki page located <a href="http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/download#fedora">here</a>.



For more information about MATE's official inclusion in Fedora, see this <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/MATE-Desktop">page</a>.



If you have any questions regarding moving from one repo to the other, please ask for help in #fedora-mate on irc.freenode.net. As always, general MATE questions can be asked in #mate.</body></html>
